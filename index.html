  <h1>Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock</h1>
  <p>This game is played entirely in your JavaScript console. Open your 
    console to continue.

  <script>

    // make a function called computerPlay to randomly return the computer's choice

    // write a function that plays a single round of the game. It should take two
    // parameters - the playerSelection and computerSelection - and return a string
    // that declares the winner of the round like so "You Lose! Paper beats Rock". 
    // Make the function case insensitive, rock, ROCK, roCK, or any other variation
    // should work.

    // You want to return the call, not console.log() them. To test you can run the
    // function inside of console.log(playRound(playerSelection, computerSelection));
